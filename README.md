# priority-list

I am making this document to better organize my head and all the projects I have floating in my head, this way I can actually finish one of them. Items are ordered in assumed priority.

List items are defined as follows:

```md
- [ ] <Name> - <Description>[ - <OptionalTechnology1>, <OptionalTechnology2>]
```

High priority should only have **ONE** project at a time.
