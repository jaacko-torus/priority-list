# priority-list

I am making this document to better organize my head and all the projects I have floating in my head, this way I can actually finish one of them. Items are ordered in assumed priority.

List items are defined as follows:

```md
- [ ] <Name> - <Description> - <Technology1>, <Technology2>, [<OptionalTechnology3>, <OptionalTechnology4>]
```

High priority should only have **ONE** project at a time.

## Medium

- [ ] Priority List - React, [FireBase]
